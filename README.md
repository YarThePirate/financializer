# Financializer

This. Is a thing.

Use it. Live it. LOVE IT. LOVE ME. I AM YOUR GOD NOW.

...Also it'll help you manage your expense later, when it doesn't suck so hard.

## Objectives
Ultimately, I would like this app to fulfil the following criteria:
- It should allow for long-term storage and retrieval of expenses
- It should allow the user to see, on any given day, how much money they will need to have available for auto-drafting to cover all of their recurring expenses
- It should allow users to easily perform CRUD operations on expenses
